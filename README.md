# NLW EXPERT (React + TypeScript + Vite)

This application was developed during Rocketseat's NLW. Experts using React, TypeScript, Tailwind for Stylesheet and also SpeechRecognition API.

The Vite template provides a minimal setup to get React working with HMR and some ESLint rules. This last one we ignore.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
